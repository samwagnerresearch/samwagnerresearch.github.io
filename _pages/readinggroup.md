Together with another PhD student, Mads Nielsen, I organize a reading group in Information Economics and Market Microstructure.

I refer to the syllabus for further information regarding the format. If you would like to join, please contact me via sam.wagner@unil.ch.

(The schedule in each syllabus is filled-in at the end of the semester due to the randomized draws at the beginning of each meeting. The google drive folder contains the presentation slides of all presenters who agreed to share them.)
